NB! A note about other operators not implemented here:

More operators (special functions) on Exprs are defined in exproperators.py,
as well as the transpose "A.T" and spatial derivative "a.dx(i)".
This is to avoid circular dependencies between Expr and its subclasses.

#--- The base object for all UFL expression tree nodes ---

class Expr(object):
    """Base class for all UFL expression types.

    *Instance properties*
        Every expression instance will have certain properties.
        Most important are the ``ufl_operands``, ``ufl_shape``,
        ``ufl_free_indices``, and ``ufl_index_dimensions`` properties.
        Expressions are immutable and hashable.

    *Type traits*
        The Expr API defines a number of type traits that each subclass
        needs to provide. Most of these are specified indirectly via
        the arguments to the ``ufl_type`` class decorator, allowing UFL
        to do some consistency checks and automate most of the traits
        for most types. The type traits are accessed via a class or
        instance object on the form obj._ufl_traitname_. See the source
        code for description of each type trait.

    *Operators*
        Some Python special functions are implemented in this class,
        some are implemented in subclasses, and some are attached to
        this class in the ``ufl_type`` class decorator.

    *Defining subclasses*
        To define a new expression class, inherit from either
        ``Terminal`` or ``Operator``, and apply the ``ufl_type`` class
        decorator with suitable arguments.  See the docstring of
        ``ufl_type`` for details on its arguments.  Looking at existing
        classes similar to the one you wish to add is a good
        idea. Looking through the comments in the ``Expr`` class and
        ``ufl_type`` to understand all the properties that may need to
        be specified is also a good idea. Note that many algorithms in
        UFL and form compilers will need handlers implemented for each
        new type.

        .. code-block:: python

            @ufl_type()
            class MyOperator(Operator):
                pass

    *Type collections*
        All ``Expr`` subclasses are collected by ``ufl_type`` in global
        variables available via ``Expr``.

    *Profiling*
        Object creation statistics can be collected by doing

        .. code-block:: python

            Expr.ufl_enable_profiling()
            # ... run some code
            initstats, delstats = Expr.ufl_disable_profiling()

        Giving a list of creation and deletion counts for each typecode.
